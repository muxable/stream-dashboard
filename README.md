# Stream Dashboard

Live streams are difficult to monitor. Currently, the accepted solution is to watch your own stream via the Twitch app, however this doesn’t give good data per-modem and is difficult to analyze after the stream has completed. This is a tool that is more useful for streamers to understand why their stream has issues and fix them accordingly.
